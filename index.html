                        <p>
                            Middle school students have a lot of energy. While we want to make sure we can accomplish eveything on our agenda, that might not happen if students are bouncing off the walls.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I've learned how to "steer" or "funnel" student energy in a direction that would lead to the accomplishment of our tasks. Rather than diluting or inhibiting such energy, I have gained insight on how to transform it in such a way that everyone benefits, rather than gets distracted by, a student's energy.

                            <p>
                                A few of our students in my film club group had an incredible amount of energy, but it <b>became distracting to other students.</b> How could I control this energy?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After reading Robert Fried's "The Passionate Teacher", and read his section on classroom discipline, I realized that it would be better to <i>redirect</i> my students' energy, rather than get rid of it. Students devoid of energy or passion would not have fun in film club.

                                Fun may be another key to renewal as passionate teachers. It can't hurt to look at each day's classes with a determination to have some fun teaching. It reminds us that in the learning business, work and play are not opposites; that most of a child's early learning comes from play; and that playfullness in a quality that adults cherish as well.

                                This passage inspired me to re-examine how I was "keeping the peace" among my students. Rather than just focusing on work or fun, I could combine them both for maximum effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Using this knowledge, I promoted some silly moments among my actors as I guided them through their scenes, but also transformed some jokes into poignant moments to remember. I also injected my own silliness into aspects of our acting lessons, and used my silliness as a moment for the actors to remember and think about throughout the acting process.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By applying the silliness in the air into a tense moment in our script, I could grab their attention and hold it tight.

                                As a teaching assistant and volunteer, students will always have expectations of an instructor who is both firm and fun. Outliers on both sides are frequent, but how is it possible to be both someone people can learn from and laugh with?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This insight will enable me to more effectively communicate and engage with students of all ages. The ideas I've learned are not specific to any age, but are universal in nature.

                                Everyone likes an instructor who gives them a challenge and can crack a joke. Whether I am in my office hours, leading a discussion section, or guiding students in the Hour of Code, there is always a sense of admiration for someone's ability to mesh work and fun. I hope to use what I have learned in that way: to be the person people look up to as a passionate and "punny" guy.

                            The energy from the previous does not exist if students aren't engaged or excited about <i>something</i> going on. Let's make them excited about film club, and give students reasons to be involved and "with it".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Afford students the opportunities and knowledge to become an active participant in a lesson; rather than a sink for knowledge (taking it in but not giving anything back,) they could become an important link in the chain of our film club group.

                                I came to this realization while preparing for my Book Lesson presentations. I was assigned the chapters on promoting student excellence. I quickly realized that excellence could only go so far as a student wanted to participate and involve themselves in the process of learning.

                                Those quotes, in addition to the survey results from students' initial placements from the start of the semester, allowed me and my other instructors to provide each student with a legitimate role and position in the film club. These were roles that they were inclined to become passionate about, and gave 110% every day in an effort to succeed and get the job done.

                                We wanted to give each student a set of responsibilities that would be suited to their strengths, but also challenge them in new ways. This connects student's excitement about something (acting, editing, camerawork) with how engaged they would be in that role.

                            The ability to assist students in becoming excited about the lesson at hand is especially poignant for me as a student. Though I often find myself on the instructor end as a TA, I can take the same lessons and apply them to my being a student.

                                Metacognition was one of the first concepts we covered in lecture; it was discussed by Professor Duff, and I wrote it in my notes as the following:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                Introspection of learning + knowledge; effectiveness of learning and consuming information so that we can use it.

                                The nature of the lectures themselves also prompted me to think about how I thought. Prof. Duff's lecture style was very different from those of other classes. This prompted me to re-examine how I took in information.

                                Through my work with DeWitt Middle School students, I learned to take information from my surroundings in a different way than before. I was now the teacher and the student. How could I transform knowledge so that it applied in both areas?

                        <p>
                            Thinking about how you think is a sort of mental "check". Have I learned something effectively? Am I thinking about something in a way that stimulates critical insight and thought about a topic? This sort of mental thought is one that should be promoted in classrooms everywhere.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I strongly believe that there is are right and wrong ways to thinking; metacognition can help both students and teachers determine how good their way of thinking is, and aid them in their endeavors to improve. Whether it is receiving knowledge, delivering it, or a combination of the two, metacognition can give individuals pause and ask them to re-examine what they are doing.
